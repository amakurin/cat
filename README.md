# caterpillar

A Clojure library designed to crawl them up!

## Usage
Well, in order to use ocr-processors, you need to install opencv to local repo:

lein localrepo install opencv/opencv-248.jar opencv/opencv 2.4.8

Database includes some triggers, so in order to migrations can be applied automatically, you need to set
[mysqld]
log_bin_trust_function_creators=TRUE
or grant SUPER privileges to the process.
